# statistics-tool
A calculator in vanilla javascript and html to calculate standard deviation, mean, and frequency distribution on more than on sample at once.

I created this webapp while taking a statistics course. I was unable to find a free web calculator that allowed me to take standard deviations
on more than one sample at a time, so I created this calculator to allow me to do that. Most calculators force you to input samples one by one.
I'm sure there is probably paid software that allows mutliple samples, but I could not find a free web app that would allow this.
